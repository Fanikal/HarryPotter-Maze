## Installation and Setup
Before running the Maze Game, please follow these initial setup steps:

**Install Required Fonts:**
   The application uses the "Zapfino" font (ZAPFINO.TTF) to correctly display the 
title text. Ensure that you have this font installed in your system's font 
directory, typically located at `C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\`.

## Running the Application
To run the Maze application, follow these steps:

**Compile and Run:**
   - In IntelliJ IDEA, locate and right-click on the `homeScreen` file.
   - Select "Run" to build and execute the Maze app.
   - *Note*: The application leverages voice recognition libraries from Sphinx. To ensure proper functionality, you need to add the `sphinx4-data-1.0.0` and `sphinx4-core-1.0.0` JAR files, which can be found in the `lib` folder of the project.
   
## Application Overview
The Harry Potter Maze Game provides an engaging and interactive gaming experience. It consists of various screens, including the home screen, select character screen, select house screen, and the game screen.

## Functionality Highlights
The Maze Game boasts a range of functionalities to enhance the gaming experience, including:

- **Maze Navigation:** Use the WASD keys or keyboard arrows to move your character through the intricate maze. Your goal is to reach the end of the maze within the given time limit.

- **Item Collection:** Collect various items, including potions to replenish health, time turners to extend your gameplay time, and the all-important wand to unlock doors.

- **Voldemort's Challenge:** To win the game, you must confront Voldemort. However, defeating him is not straightforward. You need to draw a circular shape within 5 seconds to defeat him. Be careful, as Voldemort can diminish your health on contact.

- **Voice Recognition:** Open the game by saying the magical phrase "I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good". During the game, you need to use voice recognition again to open the door that is present on the maze.

- **Character Selection:** Choose your character (Harry, Ron, or Hermione) by clicking and swiping the mouse on the character stickers.

- **House Selection:** Select your Hogwarts house (Gryffindor, Slytherin, or Hufflepuff), which also changes the maze's color.

- **Unlocking Doors:** To open the door, drag and drop the wand onto your character, then activate the voice command by repeating "Open the door" into your microphone.

- **Time Management:** Collect the time turner to gain an extra 30 seconds to explore the maze and accomplish your mission.

- **Win or Lose:** The game concludes when you either defeat Voldemort, run out of time, or lose all your lives. Choose to start a new game or return to the home screen depending on the outcome.

- **Pause and Resume:** You can pause the game at any time by pressing the SPACE button on your keyboard. Access the pause menu to resume your adventure or exit the game.

The Maze Game offers a dynamic and immersive experience through voice recognition, swipe interactions, key presses, and drag-and-drop actions.
